= Evolution Algorithm Controller =
The idea is to develop a controller for the ICARUS Jet that will be tuned based on an Evolution Algorithm.  The final controller will control each Engine's Thrust and Rotation angles, based on manual/autonomous control, flight modes and given sensor data.

For ease of development the first phase of this controller will be based on a normal quadrotor (AR Drone) simulated in VRep.  Also, the entire controller will be implemented on the Primary Controller.

== Phase 1
The Controller will consist of:
 # A Roll PID Controller
 # A Pitch PID Controller
 # A Yaw PID Controller
 # An Altitude PID Controller
 
The following equations will be used to generate the appropriate thrust from each motor, where:
FL: Thrust generated from Front-Left Engine
FR: Thrust generated from Front-Right Engine
BL: Thrust generated from Back-Left Engine
BR: Thrust generated from Back-Right Engine


=== TODO ==
 # Build PID Controller in Python
 # Build PID Tuner GUI in Python
