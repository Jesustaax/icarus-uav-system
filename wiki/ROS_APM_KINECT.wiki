#summary ROS, APM and Kinect

= Introduction =

The objective of this project is to implement a system that has a computer running ROS with a Kinect doing target tracking, and outputting commands via MAVLink to an APM Board.

This project is for the UIC ECE 452 Course: Robotics.  This is an ongoing project for the Spring 2013 Semester and as such is still a work in progress.  All code/information/documentation will be made available upon completion.
