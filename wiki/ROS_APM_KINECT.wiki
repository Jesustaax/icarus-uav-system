#summary ROS, APM and Kinect

= Introduction =

The objective of this project is to implement a system that has a computer running ROS with a Kinect doing target tracking, and outputting commands via MAVLink to an APM Board.

This project is for the UIC ECE 452 Course: Robotics.  This is an ongoing project for the Spring 2013 Semester and as such is still a work in progress.  All code/information/documentation will be made available upon completion.

  A laptop running Ubuntu 12.10 was installed with the Robot Operating System (ROS)-Groovy.  A laptop was used as it would simplify development, and the usage of ROS implies that it is somewhat device independent.   Additionally, the following packages were installed:
    * MavlinkBridge
    * Openni  

  Build RosCopter Package:
{{{
rosmake roscopter
}}}
  Start roscopter node:
{{{
cd ~/groovy_workspace/sandbox/roscopter
nodes/roscopter.py --device=/dev/ttyACM0 --rate=115200
}}}

  The [http://store.diydrones.com/APM_2_0_Kit_p/br-ardupilotmega-03.htm DIYDrones APM] is already used as a Flight Controller in the ICARUS QTW Flyer.  While it has many functions, including an AHRS System, it lacks the ability to connect to more advanced sensors (such as the Kinect) and the programming space left (after using the Arduplane/Arducopter code) is quite small. 

  * Kinect Sensor
