The ICARUS Drone Project is designed to give an AR Drone autonomous navigation along with providing a stable platform for developing machine learning algorithms.
= Goals =
== Primary ==
A) The ICARUS Drone should be capable of mapping its environment and determining where in that map it is.

B) The ICARUS Drone should be capable of identifying various Targets Of Interest in its environment and navigating between them.

C) The ICARUS Drone should be capable of interfacing with a simulation environment such that algorithms can be tested in the simulated world, as realistically as possible, before implementing in the real environment.

== Secondary ==
D) The ICARUS Drone should be capable of path planning based on targets placed on the ground.
