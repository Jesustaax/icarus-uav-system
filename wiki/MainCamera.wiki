CAD Model of the Asus Xtion Pro Camera on Grabcad

Sideview of the Asus Xtion Pro Camera mounted on the ICARUS Flyer.  The Yellow prisms are the Asus's RGB and Depth Camera FOV.  Notice that these do not interfere with the structure of the UAV or the plane of the rotating propeller (blue rectangle).  This means that the Camera should not see any of the UAV, which is preferred.
