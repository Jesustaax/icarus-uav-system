#summary Wiki page for the ICARUS Jet

= Introduction =

The ICARUS Jet is a QuadTiltJet UAV.  It includes 4 tilt-able Turbine Engines to provide high efficiency Hover and high-speed Forward flight modes.


= Tasks =
 # Develop control concepts/equations for Hover, Transition and Forward flight modes.
 # Perform system identification on turbine engine for automated control loop tuning.
 # Develop simulation of UAV in V-Rep for control loop tuning/debugging.
 # Develop mechanical design for efficient aerodynamic flight and resilient takeoff/landing maneuvers.
 # Optic Flow to measure velocity over ground, used for auto-landing.
 # Obstacle Avoidance using forward-facing camera
