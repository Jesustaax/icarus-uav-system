=== APM Analyzer ===
Current Version:  1.0
This software was created in MatLab and is used to analyze the Data Logs of the DIYDrones APM (2.0 or 2.5).  If you do not have MatLab all you need for this software is the MatLab RunTime Compiler, which is free. The original source code is also available in the download.

=== AirFoil Optimizer ===
Current Version: 1.0
This software was created in MatLab and is used to help select an airfoil given constraints.  It uses the airfoil data collected from [http://www.ae.illinois.edu/m-selig/ads/coord_database.html UIUC] and you can then filter and graph the airfoil data as you see fit. If you do not have MatLab all you need for this software is the MatLab RunTime Compiler, which is free. The original source code is also available in the download.
