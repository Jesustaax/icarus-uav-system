The objective of the AUVSI IARC 6th Mission is to have a UAV fly into an office-space (which includes hallways, rooms, rooms off rooms, etc), locate a flash-drive in an unknown location, retrieve the flash drive and leave the office-space.  The office-space is in an environment designed to simulate a foreign government with no access to GPS signals.

Two key parts of the competition are to a) navigate the office-space using the available signage placed in the environment and b) visually identify the flash drive in the office-space.  Both of these components are complex, as the signage is in a foreign language and the flash drive may be placed anywhere in the office-space.
