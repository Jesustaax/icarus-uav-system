#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =
This page contains a collection of Projects I am working on to support the ICARUS System.  At some point, I intend on entering the ICARUS QTR system into some form of advanced UAV competition, and hopefully these projects will help me earn 1st place.

= Projects =
== ROS, APM and Kinect ==
[ROS_APM_KINECT APM, ROS and Kinect]

This project was for the UIC ECE 452 Project, but I made the project suitable for the ICARUS System.  This is currently a "finished" project, although I'm sure there is much more work to be done with it.

== APM Tester ==
[APM_Tester APM Tester]

This project is to validate the precision and accuracy of the DIYDrones APM 2.0 using a PUMA Robot.

== SLAM ==
[ICARUS_SLAM SLAM]

This project is used to provide indoor GPS-like navigation to a flying quadcopter with the Microsoft Kinect and the ROS package RGBDSLAM.

== Obstacle Avoidance ==
[ICARUS_OBSTACLE_AVOIDANCE Obstacle avoidance]

This project is used to perform obstacle avoidance on a quadcopter using Ultrasonic Sensors, a Microsoft Kinect and AI algorithms.

== Target Detection ==
[TargetDetection Target Detection]

This project is used to perform target detection in an unknown environment using Neural Networks.

== ICARUS Modeling ==
[ICARUS_MODEL Modeling]
