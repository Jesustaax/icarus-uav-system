= Introduction =

The objective of this project was to analyze and provide documentation on the precision and accuracy of the Ardupilot Mega, or APM.  The APM is a fantastic piece of engineering marvel created by 3D Robotics and improved upon by the DIYDrones community, and is one of the most popular and cheapest autopilot systems for robots available.  However, there is a significant lack of proper engineering data, such as how stable the board is overtime, how accurate it is, etc. that prompted this project.

At the UIC Robotics Lab, we also have access to a few PUMA Robot Manipulators.  It was determined this would be a good platform to test the APM on, as it is a stable and accurate robot arm with many more degrees of freedom than are measured by the APM.

Although all the design and software information is made available on this site, it is not intended that this project would be replicated (unless for verification purposes) as the PUMA robot is not a common fixture in a robotics lab.  This webpage is more intended to document the way the testing data was gathered for independent analysis and educational purposes.  However, if you would like to reproduce this project by all means go for it!  There are many lessons we learned along the way that will make this project easier the next time around.
