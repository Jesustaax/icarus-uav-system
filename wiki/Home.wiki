I am building a QuadTiltWing UAV for my Thesis Project at UIC and to compete in the Sparkfun Autonomous Vehicle Competition.  Here is my Blog on the ICARUS System: http://davidgitz.blogspot.com/

I have found very little information regarding building a TiltWing UAV, at least information that is attainable to the general public.  I also believe that these kinds of vehicles are the future of Aviation, either Manned or Unmanned.  As such this Wiki also serves to disseminate as much accurate information as possible about the design, fabrication, operation and analysis of TiltWing UAV's.

= Thesis Objectives = 
  * Conduct Literature Review on TiltWing UAV's.
    * Provide analysis on failure modes of prior TiltWing UAV's.
    * Provide information on control systems, design parameters (Wing Area, Lift Moment, Airfoil profile, etc) and figures of merit on TiltWing UAV's.
  * Design QuadTiltWing (QTW) UAV capable of autonomous transition between Vertical and Horizontal Flight Modes.
    * Model QTW in Simulink to design Control System.
    * Model QTW in Star-CCM (or other CFD Package) to assist in Aerodynamic design.
    * Model QTW in Xplane to test Flight Controls (Optional).
  * Build and Test QTW
    * Build scale model of QTW.
    * Test QTW using appropriate Wind-Tunnels.
    * Perform System Identification on QTW.
    * Perform Test Flights and validate design on QTW.

= Flyer's =
I've gone through several design iterations so far on this project, from initial concepts to more refined designs.  Here are some pictures of the QTW in it's various design stages:

ICARUS QTW Flyer v4RevA-2, in Cruise Mode.  This is the most current design.

ICARUS QTW Flyer v4RevA-1, in Cruise Mode.  This was designed with Carbon Fiber as almost the entire structure, which was just too heavy.

ICARUS QTW Jet Flyer v4RevE, in Cruise Mode.  Jet Engines are neat, but too expensive.

ICARUS QTW Ducted Fan v4RevD, in Cruise Mode.  This was a try with a ducted fan embedded in each wing.  This design made the wing almost useless and unnecessarily heavy.

ICARUS QTW Flyer v4RevC, in Hover Mode.  This was a try at having each wing at ~90 degrees to each other and forming an X, to give the Flyer the ability to perform maneuvers like an advanced hover.

ICARUS QTW Flyer v4RevB, in Hover Mode.  One of my initial designs for a QuadRotor with rotating wings and rotating pylons.  Very complicated and heavy on drag, but this thing could move anyway it wanted.
